\description{
A fitted generalized additive model describing \code{max_vif} as a function of \code{max_cor} in \link{experiment_df}.
}
\details{
The model was fitted with a smooth term in \code{max_cor} (basis dimension \code{k = 9}) and cubic weights proportional to the Jaccard similarity between the results of \code{\link[=cor_select]{cor_select()}} and \code{\link[=vif_select]{vif_select()}} to emphasise cases with high agreement between the two selection methods.

\preformatted{
gam_cor_to_vif <- mgcv::gam(
 formula = max_vif ~ s(max_cor, k = 9),
 weights = experiment_df$out_selection_jaccard^3,
 data = experiment_df,
 select = TRUE
 )
}
Model performance:
\itemize{
\item Adjusted R-squared: 0.918
\item Deviance explained: 91.8\\%
\item Estimated scale: 0.238
\item Effective degrees of freedom for smooth: 7.47 (Ref.df = 8)
\item F-statistic for smooth term: 13,101 (p < 2e-16)
