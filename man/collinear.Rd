\arguments{
\item{df}{(required; dataframe, tibble, or sf) A dataframe with responses (optional) and predictors. Must have at least 10 rows for pairwise correlation analysis, and \code{10 * (length(predictors) - 1)} for VIF analysis.  Default: NULL.}

\item{responses}{(optional; character, character vector, or NULL) Name of one or several response variables in \code{df}. Default: NULL.}

\item{predictors}{(optional; character vector or NULL) Names of the predictors in \code{df}. If NULL, all columns in \code{df} except the ones in \code{responses} and those with constant values or near zero variance are used. Default: NULL}

\item{encoding_method}{(optional; character or NULL). Name of one target encoding method. One of: "loo", "mean", or "rank" (see \code{\link[=target_encoding_lab]{target_encoding_lab()}} for further details). If NULL, target encoding is disabled. Default: NULL}

\item{preference_order}{(optional; character vector, dataframe resulting from \code{\link[=preference_order]{preference_order()}}, or NULL). Prioritizes predictors to preserve the most relevant ones during multicollinearity filtering. Overrides \code{f} when not NULL.}

\item{f}{(optional: unquoted function name or NULL). Function to rank \code{predictors} depending on their relationship with the \code{responses}. Available functions are listed by \code{\link[=f_functions]{f_functions()}} and described in the manual of \code{\link[=preference_order]{preference_order()}}. Requires valid \code{responses} and \code{preference_order = NULL}. Default: \code{f_auto}}

\item{max_cor}{(optional; numeric or NULL) Maximum correlation allowed between pairs of \code{predictors}. Valid values are between 0.01 and 0.99, and recommended values are between 0.5 (strict) and 0.9 (permissive). If NULL and \code{max_vif = NULL}, it is set to the median correlation of all predictors. Otherwise it is ignored. Default: NULL}

\item{max_vif}{(optional, numeric or NULL) Maximum Variance Inflation Factor allowed for \code{predictors} during multicollinearity filtering. Recommended values are between 2.5 (strict) and 10 (permissive). If NULL and \code{max_cor = NULL}, it is configured automatically to a VIF matching the median correlation of the predictors. Otherwise it is ignored. Default: NULL.}

\item{quiet}{(optional; logical) If FALSE, messages are printed to the console. Default: FALSE}

\item{...}{(optional) Used to pass internal arguments such as \code{function_name} for \link{validate_arg_function_name} in nested calls, or \code{m}, a correlation matrix generated via \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::cor()}} or \code{\link[=cor_matrix]{cor_matrix()}}, and the cross-validation arguments of \code{\link[=preference_order]{preference_order()}}: \code{cv_iterations}, and \code{cv_training_fraction}.}
}
\value{
list of class \code{collinear_output} with sub-lists of class \code{collinear_selection}.

If \code{responses = NULL}, only one sub-list named "result" is produced. Otherwise, a sub-list named after each response is generated. A sub-list of class \code{collinear_selection} contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{response} (character): name of the response, if any.
\item \code{df} (dataframe):  input data with the given \code{response}, if any, and the selected \code{predictors}. If target encoding was triggered, then categorical predictors will show as numeric in this dataframe.
\item{preference_order} (dataframe): dataframe generated by \code{\link[=preference_order]{preference_order()}}.
\item \code{selection} (character vector): names of the selected \code{predictors}.
\item \code{formulas} (list): if \code{responses} is not NULL, list with modelling formulas generated by \code{\link[=model_formula]{model_formula()}} on the given response and the selected predictors. When the response and the predictors are numeric, the formulas "linear" and "smooth" (for GAM models) are generated. When the response is categorical, a "classification" formula is returned.
}
}
\description{
Automates multicollinearity management in datasets with mixed variable types (numeric, categorical, and logical) through an integrated system of five key components:

\itemize{

\item \strong{Target Encoding Integration} (opt-in, disabled by default): When \code{responses} is numeric, categorical variables in \code{predictors} exist, and \code{encoding_method} is specified ("loo", "mean", or "rank"), categorical predictors are transparently converted to numeric using response values as reference. This enables VIF and correlation analysis across mixed data types. See \code{\link[=target_encoding_lab]{target_encoding_lab()}} for implementation details.

\item \strong{Intelligent Predictor Ranking} (active by default): Three prioritization strategies ensure the most relevant predictors are retained during filtering:

\itemize{

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\\item **User-defined ranking** (argument \code{preference_order}): Accepts a character vector of predictor names or a dataframe resulting from [preference_order()]. When collinear predictors are detected, those with lower ranking are removed. This option focuses the analysis on predictors of particular interest.

\\item **Response-based ranking** (\code{f}): Uses functions like [f_auto], [f_numeric_glm], or [f_binomial_rf] to rank predictors by their association with the response. This functionality now supports cross-validation (see [preference_order()] for further details). Preserves predictors with stronger relationships to the response, yielding stronger predictive models. Requires valid \code{responses} and \code{preference_order = NULL}.

\\item **Multicollinearity-based ranking** (default): When both \code{preference_order} and \code{f} are \code{NULL}, predictors are ranked from lower to higher multicollinearity. This preserves rare predictors over redundant ones, but might not result in robust models.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

}

\item \strong{Unified Correlation Framework} (active by default): Computes pairwise correlations between any variable types using Pearson correlation (numeric-numeric), target encoding (numeric-categorical), and Cramer's V (categorical-categorical) within a single, consistent workflow. See \code{\link[=cor_df]{cor_df()}}, \code{\link[=cor_matrix]{cor_matrix()}}, and \code{\link[=cor_cramer]{cor_cramer()}} for details.

\item \strong{Adaptive Filtering Thresholds} (active by default): When both \code{max_cor} and \code{max_vif} are \code{NULL}, optimal thresholds are automatically determined based on the median correlation structure of the predictors (see "Adaptive Multicollinearity Thresholds" section).

\item \strong{Dual Filtering Strategy} (active by default): Combines two complementary methods while respecting predictor rankings:

\itemize{

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\\item **Pairwise Correlation Filtering**: Removes predictors with correlation or Cramer's V above \code{max_cor}. Handles all variable type combinations. See [cor_select()] for the algorithm.

\\item **VIF-based Filtering**: Removes numeric predictors with Variance Inflation Factors above \code{max_vif}. See [vif_select()], [vif_df()], and [vif()] for implementation details.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

}
}

This function accepts parallelization via \code{\link[future:plan]{future::plan()}} and progress bars via \code{\link[progressr:handlers]{progressr::handlers()}}. Parallelization benefits \code{\link[=target_encoding_lab]{target_encoding_lab()}}, \code{\link[=preference_order]{preference_order()}}, and \code{\link[=cor_select]{cor_select()}} operations, particularly with categorical variables or large datasets.
}
\section{Adaptive Multicollinearity Thresholds}{


When both \code{max_cor} and \code{max_vif} are \code{NULL}, the function automatically determines optimal filtering thresholds based on the correlation structure of the predictors:

\enumerate{

\item The median correlation between all predictors is computed via \code{\link[=cor_stats]{cor_stats()}}.

\item The value of \code{max_cor} is set to the median correlation of the dataset.

\item The value of \code{max_vif} is computed from \code{max_cor} using the model \link{gam_cor_to_vif}, which maps correlation thresholds to their equivalent VIF values.

}

Under this data-drive approach, datasets with lower median correlation receive stricter thresholds, while those with higher baseline correlation are filtered more permissively, preventing over-filtering of genuinely informative predictors.

In validation experiments (see \link{experiment_adaptive_thresholds}), this automatic configuration method decreased median correlation by an average of -0.24, and achieved an average maximum VIF of 1.40 across selections. These results indicate this system is robust to an ample set of use cases.

Users can override automatic configuration by explicitly setting either \code{max_cor} or \code{max_vif} (or both) to specific numeric values.
}

\section{Variance Inflation Factors}{


The Variance Inflation Factor of a given predictor \eqn{a} is computed as \eqn{1/(1-R2)}, where \eqn{R2} is the multiple R-squared of a multiple regression model fitted using \eqn{a} as response against all other predictors, as in  \eqn{a = b + c + ...}.

The square root of the VIF of \eqn{a} is the factor by which the confidence interval of the estimate for \eqn{a} in the linear model \eqn{y = a + b + c + ...} is widened by multicollinearity in the predictors.

The range of VIF values is (1, Inf]. The recommended thresholds for maximum VIF may vary depending on the source consulted, being the most common values, 2.5 (most conservative), 5, and 10 (most permissive).
}

\section{VIF-based Filtering}{


This algorithm, implemented in \code{\link[=vif_select]{vif_select()}}, selects numeric predictors with a Variance Inflation Factor lower than \code{max_vif} while preserving those with a higher ranking in \code{preference_order}, if provided.

The algorithm works as follows:

\enumerate{

\item All numeric predictors are ranked according to the argument \code{preference_order}, or from lower to higher VIF with the other predictors (as computed by \code{\link[=vif_df]{vif_df()}}) otherwise. Categorical predictors are ignored.

\item The predictor with the higher rank is added to the selection.

\item The VIF of the next predictor in the ranking against the predictor/s in the selection is computed via \code{\link[=cor_matrix]{cor_matrix()}} and \code{\link[=vif]{vif()}}. If the resulting VIF is lower than \code{max_vif}, the new predictor is added to the selection. Otherwise it is removed.

\item Step 3 is repeated until all predictors are processed.

}

This filtering method ensures that all predictors in the selection are correlated below \code{max_vif} and that the selection respects the prioritization defined in \code{preference_order}.
}

\section{Pairwise Correlation Filtering}{


This algorithm is implemented in \code{\link[=cor_select]{cor_select()}}, and selects numeric and categorical predictors with Pearson correlation or Cramer's V association lower than \code{max_cor} while preserving those with a higher ranking in \code{preference_order}, if provided.

It works as follows:

\enumerate{

\item The correlation matrix of all predictors is computed, its diagonals are set to zero, and the rows and columns are ordered according to \code{preference_order}, or from lower to higher sum of correlations with the other predictors ((\code{\link[=colSums]{colSums()}} applied to the output of \code{\link[=cor_matrix]{cor_matrix()}})) otherwise.

\item The predictor with the higher rank is added to the selection.

\item The correlation/s between the predictor/s in the selection and the next predictor in the ranking is/are extracted from the global correlation matrix. If the maximum correlation is below the value of \code{max_cor}, the new predictor is added to the selection. Otherwise it is removed.

\item Step 3 is repeated until all predictors are processed.

}

This filtering method ensures that all predictors in the selection are correlated below \code{max_cor} and that the selection respects the prioritization defined in \code{preference_order}.
