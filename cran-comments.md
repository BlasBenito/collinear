## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted all relative URIs in README.md to absolute URLs pointing to the pkgdown site (https://blasbenito.github.io/collinear/). This addresses the "possibly invalid file URIs" note from the previous submission.

## Test environments

* macOS 14 (local), R 4.4.1
* Ubuntu 22.04 (GitHub Actions), R devel, release, oldrel
* Windows Server 2022 (GitHub Actions), R release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔

## win-builder (R-devel) results

Status: 1 NOTE

1. **Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION**
   * "VIF" — This is an established statistical abbreviation (Variance Inflation Factor).
