    title: "Multicollinearity Hinders Model Interpretability"
    description: "This post delves into the intricacies of model interpretation under the influence of multicollinearity, and use R and a toy data set to demonstrate how this phenomenon impacts both linear and machine learning models."

    title: "Everything About Variance Inflation Factors"
    description: "This post dives deep Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) and their crucial role in identifying multicollinearity within linear models. It uses R code extensively to illustrate various concepts, making it a practical guide for those well-versed in R."
